The ''Attempts'' class is a Java program that figures out how many tries it takes to generate a specific word by cycling through all possible combinations of letters from 'A' to 'Z'. It starts with shorter strings and gradually increases the length until it matches the target word. The program prints each attempt along the way and counts the total number of tries needed. The code is neatly organized into different methods for generating combinations, calculating the total attempts, and finding character positions, making it both functional and easy to follow.
